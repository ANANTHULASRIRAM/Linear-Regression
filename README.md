# Linear-Regression
Experimentation using scikit learn Linear regression

A dataset with a target variable and 1 feature is used to demonstrate the working of a Linear regression model. Upon training the model, the target variable is predicted for a given input and the model is evaluated using various metrics. The regression line is visualized using matplotlib and a pre built model is imported from scikit learn for this study.
